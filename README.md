True Darkness Tweak for FORGE

A few tweaks to the True Darkness (www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/true-darkness) code to implement 
some features I wanted to use. This adds support for a few config values to manipulate the darkness values 
against the current moon brightness. I also added a simple server-side check and maybe other minor things.

Can be phased out if ever similar things are added to the referenced mod.
This would be my first attempt to release something, good luck lol!
